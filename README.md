# BERT-QA: Question Answering with BERT over Knowledge Graphs

BERT-QA is an advanced academic project that employs language models for returning relevant answers to natural language questions. The process involves:

1. Extracting the queried entity and linking it to a unique machine ID.
2. Recognizing the relation being questioned about the entity.
3. Using the aforementioned information to query on a knowledge graph.
4. Retrieving the answer based on the graph's data.
